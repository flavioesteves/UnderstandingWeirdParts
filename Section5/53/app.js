/**
 * Object-Oriented
 * Conceptual Aside: Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance
 * 
 * INHERITANCE: One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.
 * 
 * CLASSICAL INHERITANCE: C#, JAVA is a way of sharing and properties
 *  Downside: 
 *          -Verbose: friend, protected, private, interface
 *          
 * PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE: Simple, flexible, extensible, easy to understand
