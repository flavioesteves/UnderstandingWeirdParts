/**
 *  19 - Types and Javascript
 *  -Is Dynamic Typing
 *  -Static Typing example: C#, JAVA
 * 
 * 
 *  20 - 6 Primitive Types(A type od data that represents a single value is not a object):
 *  -Boolean: true or false
 *  -undefined: represents lack of existence (shouldn't set a variable to this)
 *  -null: represents lack of existence (use to set a variable to this)
 *  -Number: floating point number
 *  -String: 'characters' or "characters"
 *  -SYMBOL: new in ES6
 * 
 * pseudo primitive - NaN (not a number)
 * 
 *  21 - Operators  - special function with 2 values return 1
 *  = + - / *
 * 
 *  22 - Operator Precedence and Associativity
 *  -Functions are called in order of precedence (HIGHER precedence wins)
 *  -ASSOCIATIVITY: what order operator functions get called in left-to-right or right-to-left, when functions have same precedence
 *  -Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence
 * 
 *  24 - Coercion
 *  - Converting a value from one type to another: this happens quite often in Javascript because it's dynamically typed.
 * 
 *  25 - Comparison operators 
 *  -Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness
 * 
 *  27 - Existence and Booleans
 *  - if (a) { is true if the var is not = "", null , undefined or 0}
 * 
 *  28 - Default values
 *  - is good to put default values example: name = name || '<Your default value>' // care with =0
